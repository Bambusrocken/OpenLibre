# OpenLibre
The OpenLibre app for Android can be used to read the tissue glucose measurement data from the FreeStyle Libre CGM device using a NFC capable phone.

Its allows users to see the current tissue glucose level as well an estimation of the current blood glucose level based on the tissue glucose levels from the past 15 minutes.
Historic data are visualized graphically in a plot.

## Privacy
The data read from the sensor is only stored locally on the phone, but can be exported to the phone's memory in JSON format.
Crash reports can be send to the author only after manual confirmation by the user.
